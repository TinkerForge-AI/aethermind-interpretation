    """
    Analyzes motion patterns in a video clip. For now, returns a stubbed dictionary.
    Later versions may track egocentric motion (e.g. walking vs running), 
    sudden turns, object interactions, etc.

    Parameters:
        video_path (Path): Path to the video file to analyze.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary describing motion-related features, such as:

              - "motion_intensity": float from 0 to 1
